# Projected Capacitive Touch Sensor

This project implements the basic components of a capacitive touch screen node. 

## Description

A signal is generated by DDFS and is transmitted onto a conductor, that signal couples capacitively to a second intersecting conductor that is constantly sampled by and ADC. The capacitive coupling, and thus the sampled signal's magnitude, changes whenever another capacitive material (stylus/finger) is within proximity of the intersecting conductors. These changes are quantified and displayed on the Nexys 4 DDR's seven-segment display.
